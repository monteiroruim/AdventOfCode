# Advent Of Code
In this repo you will find the solutons for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) exercises in both Python and Swift languages.

We are doing it for fun and we plan to release solutions to all problems (since 2015).

Note, that probably there are more straightforward or performance wise solutions.
