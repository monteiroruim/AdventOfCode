# Advent Of Code
In this repo you will find the solutons for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) exercises in both Python and Swift languages.

We are doing it for fun and we plan to release solutions to all problems (since 2015).

Note, that probably there are more straightforward or performance wise solutions.



## Structure
Each Language has it's own structure and can be generalized with 
- AoCLanguange
  - MainYear.languageExtension <- will contain the instances of the classes and the necessary methods set to achieve the program results
  - AoCYearNumber
    - dDayNumber.languageExtension <- will host the class, class variables and class methods

* AoC = Advent of Code

## Libraries
We will try to use only native built in libraries to each one of the programing languages without specific import

those files can be executed directly with (python, swift) without need of additional extensions installation by setting the input data and executing the files
